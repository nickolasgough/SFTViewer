Welcome to the SFT Viewer study. 

If the text in this file flows off the viewable region within your text editor, you can usually enable word wrapping by selecting "view" or "format" from the menu bar and then selecting "word wrap" or "dynamic word wrap".

*** Read the following carefully to understand how to complete the study. *** 

The study will last for approximately one month. It will consist of you viewing your own PDF documents using the viewer and completing search tasks with the provided documents as well as your own documents. You are required to complete questionnaires between each search task. Everything will be explained below. 

Note SFT refers to "Space Filling Thumbnails".

IMPORTANT: You will be asked to provide your email address. Please provide an email address you check often, and if you do not check your email daily, please do so as you will be receiving emails throughout the study on how to complete the study. The email will usually contain brief instructions asking you to complete a specific search task under a certain condition [see Your Tasks below].

IMPORTANT: You will be assigned an ID number. Be sure to use this ID number when completing the small demographics questionnaire that pops up the first time you use the viewer and use this same ID when completing the questionnaires throughout the study. If you forget your ID, you can find it by selecting "Help" from the menu bar at the top of the viewer and you will see a menu item labeled "Your ID" that will display your ID after you have completed the demographics questionnaire that pops up the first time you open the viewer (for example, if your ID is 2, you should see "Your ID: 2" when you select the "Help" item from the menu bar). 

Note the SFT Viewer (also called "pdfviewer_V7.jar") may take some time to start when it is run, so please be patient and do not click the runnable jar file multiple times. The viewer may also take time to open a document or to start a search task, so please be patient with it. You will likely see spinning circles when the viewer is loading.

Note the viewer will disappear when you start a search task, so please be patient while the search task is loaded. There will be no loading window.

*** Please read the entire file before beginning the study. ***

Before beginning the study, please complete the following list:
1. Go to "https://fluidsurveys.usask.ca/s/SFTConsentDemo1/" (without the quotations) and carefully read the consent form. If you are willing to participate, click "Yes - I want to participate in this study". After completing the consent form you will be redirected to a demographics questionnaire. Please complete this questionnaire to the best of your knowledge and submit it.
2. Go to "https://fluidsurveys.usask.ca/s/SFTEmailInfo/" and provide the email address you would like to receive the study notifications and updates. Don't forget to check this email daily.
3. If you have not already done so, go to "https://www.dropbox.com/s/gsimzoi7ja94wsh/pdfviewer.zip?dl=0" (without the quotations) to download the SFT Viewer package as a zip file by clicking download in the top-right corner of the webpage or by selecting the "pdfviewer.zip" file and clicking download near the top of the webpage. The file will have to be extracted before you can use the SFT Viewer. Below are instructions for unzipping/extracting the file [see Unzipping/Extracting The Package]. This README file will be included in the package.
4. Run the "pdfviewer_V7.jar" file by double-clicking it or running it on the terminal [see Basic Usage]. The first time the viewer is run, a small questionnaire will appear. Complete this questionnaire with the ID you were assigned and keep the information provided on this window consistent with the information you provided in the online demographics form. 

*** Unzipping/Extracting The Package: ***

The package should be in your Downloads folder, which can be accessed via the Folders icon on your task bar if you are using Linux or Mac OS, or via the start menu and on some Windows systems. On Mac OS, you will likely have to open your Finder on the bottom task bar and navigate to your Downloads folder. Linux users can access the Downloads folder via the files manager, which is Dolphin on Mageia and Files on Ubuntu, both of which are located on the task bar. The package should be named "pdfviewer" or "pdfviewer.zip" depending on the platform you are using. Either way, it should be labelled as a zipped package within the Downloads folder. Below are descriptions on how to extract the package for three different operating systems. Please follow the instructions for the operating system you are using. 

Windows:
If you downloaded the package from the link above, the package should be in your Downloads folder. Simply navigate to your Downloads folder or wherever you placed it when you downloaded it, right-click the pdfviewer zipped package, and select "Extract all". A window will appear asking where you would like to place the extracted package. If you simply click "Extract" in the bottom right corner, the package should be extracted into your Downloads folder. Feel free to relocate the new pdfviewer folder to a location that is more convenient, such as your desktop, but please do keep the extracted files together in one folder. 

Mac OS:
If you downloaded the package from the link above, the package should be in your Downloads folder. Simply navigate to your Downloads folder or wherever you placed the package when you downloaded it, right-click the pdfviewer zipped package, and click Archive Utility. This will extract the pdfviewer within the Downloads folder or wherever the pdfviewer is located. Mac OS users should be able to achieve this by simply double clicking the zipped package. Either way, the extracted package should appear as a new folder within your Downloads folder or wherever it is you extracted the package. Feel free to relocate the package to a location that is more convenient by clicking-and-dragging the pdfviewer folder to the new location, such as your desktop, but please do keep the extracted files together in one folder. 

Linux:
If you downloaded the package from the link above, the package should be in you Downloads folder. Simply navigate to your Downloads folder or wherever you placed the package when you downloaded it, right-click the file, click "Extract", and then click "Extract here" to extract the package within the Downloads folder or wherever you have it placed. This will extract the package as a new folder in your Downloads folder or wherever it is you extracted the file. Feel free to relocate the pdfviewer folder to a location that is more convenient by clicking-and-dragging the pdfviewer folder to the new location, such as your desktop, but please do keep all the extracted files together in one folder. 

IMPORTANT: The extracted package will contain the folders "data", "docs", and "participant". Do not move these out of the folder or delete them and do not move files out of these folders or delete files in these folders. If you would like to move the extracted folder to a more convenient location, do so before running the viewer for the first time. This is essential because the viewer's location in your computer will be stored and used to enable the viewer to be set as the default viewer. 

*** Basic Usage: ***

The PDFViewer can simply be opened by executing the jar file (called "pdfviewer_V7.jar"). This can be accomplished by either double-clicking the jar file or running it on the terminal using the command "java -jar pdfviewer_V7.jar" within the directory storing the jar file. If you are unfamiliar with using a terminal (also called command-line or command-prompt), please just double-click the "pdfviewer_V7.jar" to run the viewer, or simply double-click the document if you followed the instructions below to set the viewer as the default viewer. Once the program opens, you may open a document with the viewer by simply clicking on the File -> Open -> File... from the menu bar in the top left corner of the viewer. After a document has been opened, you can switch between the viewer and the SFT interface by clicking the middle mouse button that is also the mouse wheel (the third button) or right-clicking. Once the SFT thumbnail interface is open, you can visit one of the pages by clicking the mouse on the thumbnail of the page you would like to visit. If the height or width of the thumbnails falls below their respective preferred value, an enlarged thumbnail will follow the mouse and display an enlarged version of the thumbnail the mouse is currently over. There is also a column of thumbnails that can be toggled by clicking the third button from the left side of the viewer near the top (it looks like a page with tiny writing on only the left side). These thumbnails work similarly to the SFT thumbnails in that clicking the thumbnail of the page you would like to visit will display that page.
To begin a random search task, click the button in the bottom right corner corresponding to the condition you would like to complete [see below for more information on the conditions and how to complete the search tasks]. 

You may also navigate using page-up, page-down, ctr+Home, ctrl+End, and the arrow keys. 

Note if you are using a Mac, the middle mouse button must be set to "Button 3" to be able to switch between the viewer and the SFT interface.

Note that thumbnails surrounded by a red border are pages that have already been visited. The thumbnail surrounded by a blue border is the page that is currently open in the viewer.

*** Your Tasks: ***

1) Search Tasks with given documents:  
Search tasks consist of twelve trials in which a page will be displayed on the right side of the screen. One trial is defined as locating one page. The page on the right side of the screen is the page you are required to locate. How you are able to locate the page will depend on which condition you choose and will be explained in more detail below. To indicate you think you have located the correct page, click the mouse over the document when in the viewer. If you have located the correct page, the window on the right displaying the page to be found will momentarily disappear and then display another page that must be located and the viewer will disappear. You will be granted one second to view the page that must be located before the trial begins. You will know the trial has begun when the viewer appears on the left of the screen. The viewer will start you at a specific page at the beginning of each trial. You will know the search task has ended when a small window appears and says, "Congratulations. You have successfully completed the search task."

There are three conditions: "Thumbs", "Scroll", and "Scroll and Thumbs". 
The "Thumbs" condition will not allow you to scroll at all. To complete the search task you must switch to the SFT interface by clicking the middle mouse button and locate the correct page by clicking the thumbnail to visit the page and then clicking the viewer to indicate you have found the page. You are free to switch back to the viewer, but the viewer cannot be used to locate the page. 
The "Scroll" condition will not allow you to use the SFT interface. To complete the search task you must scroll with either the mouse wheel or the scrollbar on the right side of the viewer. Once you have found the page, click on the viewer to indicate you have found the page. 
The "Scroll and Thumbs" condition allows you to use the scrollbar on the right side of the viewer as well as the scrollable column of thumbs on the left side of the viewer to locate the correct page. The column of thumbnails on the left side of the viewer will always be visible throughout the search task and will scroll along with the full page view. The left column of thumbnails has its own scrollbar which can be used to scroll through the thumbnails (this includes the mouse wheel), but the full page view will be unaffected by this movement.

Note the trial will not end simply because you have clicked on the viewer to indicate you have found the page. You must click the viewer on the correct page in order for the trial to end. 

Note that a document must already be open to complete a search task and the document currently open will be used as the document to complete the task. 

  - Throughout each week an email will be sent to the email address you provided us and ask you to complete a specific search task. Feel free to complete the search task anytime throughout the day, but do complete it on the same day you received the email or at your earliest convenience. To complete the specified search task, click "Search Tasks" -> "Document" -> "Condition" from the menu bar at the top of the viewer, where the condition and document are replaced with what is specified in the email (for example, "Search Tasks" -> "10 Page Document" -> "Thumbs Condition" if the email asked you to complete a search task using the 10 page document under the "Thumbs" condition). Only complete the specified task once, or as many times as specified by the email, but be sure to give yourself enough time to complete the entire task. Complete the questionnaire after completing the search task specified by the email [see Questionnaire Link below]. Remember to use the ID you were assigned. 
  
Remember that the study takes place over approximately a month. Do not overwhelm yourself by completing all conditions for all the documents at once. Though the search tasks may seem easy for the shorter documents, the tasks will take longer to complete and require more effort with the longer documents. I would recommend all the documents, the jar file, and the logging files all be kept within one directory (folder). Please do not delete any of the logging files and email the files if they are requested. 

   ** Questionnaire Link: **
   "https://fluidsurveys.usask.ca/s/SFTPost-Condition/" (without the quotations).
   
Note there is a menu item in the viewer under "Help" that will open the post-condition questionnaire in your browser.

2) Using the PDF viewer with your own documents:
  - This simply consists of using the viewer to view your own documents as you normally would with your usual viewer application. This could be viewing a PDF document to do research or viewing an online verion of a textbook. 

*** Setting The Viewer As The Default Application Used To Open PDF Files: ***

Note this does not need to be done to use the viewer and to complete the study, but it is recommended for your convenience. 

Windows:
A .bat script (A Microsoft Batch Script called "pdfviewer.bat") will be created after the viewer is run for the first time. Right-click on a PDF document (it can be one of the provided documents) and select "properties". Near the top of the new window that pops up it should say "Opens With" and then display the application that will be used to open the file. Click the "change" button next to this spot and find the .bat file ("pdfviewer_V7.jar") in the same directory as the viewer ("pdfviewer_V7.jar") by clicking browse and then navigating to the folder with the viewer and .bat script. Once you've selected the .bat file, then select open -> OK -> Apply -> OK. You should now be finished and you can open a PDF file by simply double-clicking the file.

The viewer cannot yet be set as the default viewer on other operating systems.  

Remember not to change the locations of any of the folders.

*** Logging: ***

After filling out the demographic information when the viewer is run for the first time, a file called "participant_data.txt" will be created within the participant directory of the package. This will store your information so you do not have to complete the demographic information on each subsequent usage. Please do not move or delete this file. 

Logging files will be created every time you open a document. These files will be named according to your username, document name, and the date and time. These files will log your usage as you view a document in the viewer. Logging files will also be created each time you complete a task, but these files will store data on your results of the search tasks. These files will be named according to your ID, document name, and the date and time. Here are some examples:
Casual usage: "hcilab_10PageDocument_None_15_07_2016_14_20_56.txt".
Search Task: "0_10PageDocument_Thumbnails_15_07_2016_15_03_18.txt".

If anything should go wrong with writing the files or sending them to the lab, you should be notified via a pop-up window. Please read it because it may contain the file name. Do not delete any of the files in case your data does not get sent. Please send the data to our email as a compressed file only if requested. 

*** Help: ***

You can find your ID, and links to this README and the SFT study webpage in the "Help" menu from the menu bar.

If you have any questions, do not be afraid to ask. If you have any issues or suggestions, we would like to hear about them.
